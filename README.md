# UART-ortle
Basys 2 implementation of a UART

I'm (Slowly) putting up every Basys 2 project I can find from my university days because people keep asking me questions on my required youtube showcase of the working project. 

This was several years ago, I don't have my basys2 anymore, nor the IDE(?) i used to develop it... so there's little I can do to help you troubleshoot any errors. 

This was also originally developed "in spanish" so some variable names may be spanish words... I guess you can try to look it up. 

There may also be inside jokes that don't make sense to anybody anymore. 

Look, here are the files, try to run it and figure it out :)
